# hello-world
Just another repository
I am a kid from ohio learning about coding and I hope to one day make a real difference in the tech world. I enjoy traveling and I have been to nearly every continent.  I play soccer and volleyball quite often and I am pretty good at football.  I speak spanish along with english and I'm working on a few other languages.
